Hi, I'm Jakub! 👋

I'm a software developer from Dortmund, Germany.

I mainly create websites, this is currently my main specialization. In my projects I use technologies such as HTML - CSS - JavaScript and additionaly Next.js and Tailwind CSS. However, these are not the only technologies I use or have used in the past.

Cloud technologies - this is the next topic that I am constantly discovering. I try to leran about typical cloud services and various concepts related to it. 

In addition, I'm also interested in things like cloud computing, computers in general, artificial intelligence, machine learning, web development technologies and so on.
